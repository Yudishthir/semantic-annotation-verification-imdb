		"reviewBody": "I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don\u0027t feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.\n\nIt is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn\u0027t need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn\u0027t win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don\u0027t let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb\u0027s top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.\n\nSet aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
